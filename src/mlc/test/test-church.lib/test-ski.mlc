|* Combinators for SKI combinatorial logic
I := [x. x].
K := [x. [_. x]].
S := [x. [y. [z. (z; x) (z; y)]]].

|* Combinators from Haskell Curry's B, C, K, W system
B := [x. [y. [z. z; y; x]]].
C := [x. [y. [z. y; x (z)]]].
W := [x. [y. y; x (y)]].

Echo "Testing S, K, I combinators".
I (seven).
K (six) (three).

|* K is true, S K is false, and postfix (K; S) K is not
|*          = K; S
K.
K; S.
true (K; S) (K).
false (K; S) (K).

|* These expressions reduce to I, S, K respectively
S (K) (I) (K (I) (S)).
K (S) (I (S (K) (S) (I))).
S (K) (I) (K).

Echo "Testing B, C, W combinators".
|* Pairs of lines reduce to identical normal forms
B.
S (S; K) (K).
C.
S (S (K (S (S; K) (K))) (S)) (K; K).
W.
S (S) (K; S).
I.
W (K).
|* These three have identical normal forms
S.
B (B (W; B) (C)) (B; B).
B (W; B) (B (B) (C)).

Echo "Testing SCAM name capture case".
|* This is the term which alerted me to the fact that the the paper's
|* handling of bound variables in alpha conversion was erronous--they're
|* not alpha-converted so we end up with inadvertant capture.  That's
|* what set me down the road of adding De Bruijn indexes alongside
|* memory-address-based free variables and explicit substitution nodes.
S (K (S)) (K).
