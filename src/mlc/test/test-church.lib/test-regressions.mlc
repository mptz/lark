|* These are all cases which broke at some point along the way while
|* I was struggling to get De Bruijn index shifting logic correct.
div (six, two).
pred-primitive (one).
#0 divmod (five, two).
#1 divmod (five, two).
cube (one).
pow (one, one).

|* And these are cases which broke when I was converting from ES/bites
|* to nodes
sub (two, one).

|* This case broke when I added arity; it actually revealed an existing
|* bug in uncrumbling (using unshifted rather than shifted index for
|* name lookups) which happened to be easier to trigger with arity.
